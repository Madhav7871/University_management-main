Unlike bar graphs that emphasize precise numerical comparisons, the pie chart's segmented design immediately draws attention to which nationalities account for the largest shares of extended stays - critical information for targeted marketing and resource allocation. The circular format naturally highlights dominant markets (like Portugal's 25% share in the example) while still showing smaller segments, enabling quick identification of high-potential demographics for extended-stay promotions. This approach aligns perfectly with hotel managers' need to grasp market distribution at a glance, without getting bogged down in complex cross-tabulations."

        "The bar chart analysis of cancellation rates by lead time reveals several key insights that can directly inform hotel booking policies. The data shows a clear, steady increase in cancellations as the booking window lengthens, with last-minute bookings (0-7 days) having just an 8% cancellation rate compared to 62% for reservations made 90+ days in advance. The most dramatic jump occurs between 30-60 days, where cancellation rates surge from 38% to 58%, marking this as a critical threshold for policy intervention. These patterns suggest that flexible cancellation terms can safely be offered for bookings made within 30 days of arrival, while stricter measures like non-refundable deposits or prepayment requirements should apply to reservations made further in advance. The near-linear progression of risk indicates that cancellation policies could be effectively tiered, with progressively stricter terms for 30-60 day, 60-90 day, and 90+ day booking windows."
